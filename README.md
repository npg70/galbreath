# Galbreath Geneaology

Currently focused on Campbeltown, Argyll, Scotland in the 1700s and 1800s, and descendants of Robert Galbreath b. 1778 who immigrated to Clermont County, Ohio in 1818.

## Descendants of James Galbreath and Mary Nielson

Sprawling family in Campbeltown with multiple immigrants to United States.

## Descendants of William Galbreath and Margaret Dunlop of Campbeltown

The children and grandchildren were influential in government and industry in Campbeltown and Glasgow.  

The rumour is that William somehow a descendant of Archibald Galbreath of the previous line. It appears there are no direct-male descendants, so it may remain a mystery. 

## Lineage of Alexander Galbreath


Alexander Galbreath emmigrated from Kintrye in the 1850s to West Virgina and Ohio. However, his parents are somewhat of a mystery.
