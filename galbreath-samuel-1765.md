# Samuel Galbreath

Birth and parents are unknown.  Samuel is a unusual name for a Galbreath in Campbeltown which makes it more mysterious.  A guess of 1765 would make first child born when he was 28 which seems reasonable.

- birth: Abt 1765

Kirkmichael isn't far from Campbeltown, but we are just guessing at this point. (Samuel on [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/K8LR-Y3X) )
