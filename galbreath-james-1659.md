Children of James and Mary (Nielson) Galbreath:[^children]

1. [*James Galbreath*](galbreath-james-1672.md), b. 25 Aug 1672; m. *Mary Fleming*. Recorded under "James Galbreath/Mary Neilsone."
2. *Patrick Galbraith*, b. 28 Oct 1674, Kilkeddan, Argyll, Scotland. Possibly married *Bessie Watson* on 4 Jan 1700, recorded under "Cabreth." But no record of any children.
3. [*Archibald Galbreath*](galbreath-archibald-1678.md), b. 17 Jul 1678; m. *Elizabeth Johns*.
4. [*John Galbreath*](galbreath-john-1680.md), bp. 30 May 1680; m. *Mary Mitchell*.
5. *Matthew Galbreath*, b. 15 Mar 1691, d. 1760? (unsourced).

[^birth]: The 1650 is a best guess. There is a record of a James Galbreath being baptized in 1659, son of X and Y. Assuming that is close to birth, that would mean he married and had children at age 13. It's possible it was a late baptism done when the parents moved into the area, however this is just speculation. 

[^mary]: Again, birth of 1650 is an estimate.
