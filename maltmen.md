> Agnes Galbraith Wallace was born in Ayrshire in 1867, the daughter of a Farmer.
> In 1889, she married James Greenlees in Campbeltown.
> James and his brother, William, were distillers and co-owners of
> Longrow Distillery. In 1912, William bought 100 shares and Agnes
> bought 50 shares in the Picture House. I thought it strange that
> James didnâ€™t buy any shares but then I looked a bit closer at the list of original shareholder names.
>
> Agnes and James Greenlees had four sons, John, Robert Wallace, William and James. 
> Two hundred shares were purchased in 1912, with the boys being named as the shareholders.
