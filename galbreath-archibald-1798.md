# Archibald Galbreath

The interweb gives various account of the Archibald Galbreath who married Margaret McMillian:

1. b. 1790, child of David Galbraith b. 1761 and Margaret Baird b. 1742.  Might be referring to [David Galbreath](galbreath-david-abt-1720.md), who married Martha Baird? No records of an Archibald, and unlikely she had a child at age 48.
2. b. 1798, child of David Galbraith b. 1755 and Mary Fleming b. 1765. Dates referred to [David Galbreath](galbreath-david-1755.md).  However it would mean Archibald was 15 when married.  Unlikley.
3. b. 1794, d. Death	25 Dec 1859 Saddell, Argyll, Scotland, child of [Donald Galbreath](https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/record-results?search_type=people&event=%28B%20OR%20C%20OR%20S%29&record_type%5B0%5D=opr_births&church_type=Old%20Parish%20Registers&dl_cat=church&dl_rec=church-births-baptisms&surname=galbreath&surname_so=syn&forename=donald&forename_so=syn&sex=M&from_year=1760&to_year=1770&parent_names_so=exact&parent_name_two_so=exact&record=Church%20of%20Scotland%20%28old%20parish%20registers%29%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20Other%20churches) b. 1767 and [Margaret Taylor](https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/record-results?search_type=people&event=%28B%20OR%20C%20OR%20S%29&record_type%5B0%5D=opr_births&church_type=Old%20Parish%20Registers&dl_cat=church&dl_rec=church-births-baptisms&surname=taylor&surname_so=exact&forename=margaret&forename_so=starts&sex=F&from_year=1766&to_year=1766&parent_names=taylor&parent_names_so=exact&parent_name_two=brown&parent_name_two_so=exact&county=ARGYLL&record=Church%20of%20Scotland%20%28old%20parish%20registers%29%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20Other%20churches) b. 1766.
