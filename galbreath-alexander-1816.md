- The entry for [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9NN7-9JW) and other places lists Lochgilphead as possible birth place.  Note that the Parish wasn't built until 1828, see [FamilySearch entry for Lochgilphead](https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/Lochgilphead,_Argyllshire,_Scotland_Genealogy).  That's at least [60 miles/100km](https://goo.gl/maps/g6foj1kRxvH4bXz39) from Southend Parish, and would require going through Campbeltown.  So either they wanted a water view, Lochilphead is incorrect, or we have two Alexanders.
