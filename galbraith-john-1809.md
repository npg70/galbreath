> Perhaps the most distinguished member of the family who remained

- Note error in death.  Says 1861 but should be 1881
- Here the "emmigrant" refers to [Alexander Galbreath](galbreath-alexander-1753.md) (to immigrated to Balitmore).
- "John in Kilteddan and Mary Mitchell" is [John Galbreath](galbreath-john-1680.md) (also "Kilteddan" is never defined the article, a Google returns nothing).
- "oldest son Archibald" is [Archibald Galbreath](galbreath-archibald-1708.md)

From Angus Martin's "Campbeltown Whisky: An Encyclopaedia", page 77:

> His Galbraith family was not native Kintyre stock,
> but descended from  17th century Lowland settlers. John's
> parents were Archibald Galbreath, merchant, and Jean
> Corbet. His grandfather, Archibald Galbreath, was a 
> merchant in Campbeltown, and his great-grandfather,
> William, was a maltster.
