Perhaps the most distinguished member of the family who remained in Kintyre was John Galbraith (1809-1861) who was Provost of the Burgh from 1860 till 1866 and whose daughter married the ill-fated banker James Nicol Fleming (Magazine No. 28). He too was descended like the emigrant from John in Kilteddan and Mary Mitchell, but through their oldest son Archibald.
